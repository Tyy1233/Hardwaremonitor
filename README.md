# Hardwaremonitor
This is a awesome tool to find out what might be wrong with your PC. This code allows for a log to be make of spikes in a section of hardware that might be creating problems for your computer. The hardware is: CPU, Memory, GPU and Harddrives. There will also be a list of the top 5 proccesses in the log. 
This program is ready for use with a simple Exe.
The exe is located in the dist/startstopfunction/startstopfunction.exe 
I reccommend creating a shortcut for it.
